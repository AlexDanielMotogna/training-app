## Key Concepts

### Hybrid Training Model

- **Coach Plan**: Template-based workouts assigned by position and training type
- **Free Sessions**: Player-created workouts from catalog or custom exercises
- **Compliance**: Calculated only from coach plan completion
- **Score**: Considers both plan and free work with weighting and caps

### Exercise System

- **Global Catalog**: 60+ pre-loaded professional exercises
- **Custom Exercises**: Players can create custom exercises if not found in catalog
- **Specific vs Non-Specific**: Coach can mark free exercises to affect scoring
- **YouTube Integration**: All URLs sanitized to embed format

### Attendance

- **Schedule**: Tuesday & Thursday 19:00-21:00 (Europe/Vienna)
- **Default Status**: Absent unless player checks in
- **Check-in Window**: 15 minutes before to 15 minutes after start time
- **Coach Control**: Only coach/admin can edit attendance records

### Labels

Players are automatically labeled based on behavior:
- **MACHINE**: Consistent high performance
- **STEADY**: Regular adherence to plan
- **IRREGULAR**: Inconsistent training patterns
- **LAZY**: Low adherence and participation

## Mock Data

This UI-only version uses localStorage for data persistence. All user data, check-ins, and preferences are stored locally.

## Internationalization

The app supports English (EN) and German (DE) with full translation coverage. Language preference is persisted in localStorage.

## Accessibility

- All inputs have proper labels
- ARIA attributes for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Mobile-first responsive design
